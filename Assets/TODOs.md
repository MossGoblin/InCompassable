# PATH FINDING WAYS

- Color gradient for the map
  - single color gradient is too smooth and is not helpful enough
- Detail density - certain small details is more often seen towards the center of the map
- Players leaving trails
  - either all the time (crumbs) or 
  - for a time after passing through a specific type of terrain (mud trails)
- Color lighting - directional light for the whole map, leaving shadows of certain color??
